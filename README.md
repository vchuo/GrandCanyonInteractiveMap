Grand Canyon Interactive Map
============================

> This web-based, interactive map of the Grand Canyon was developed as part of a parent project in a digital humanities lab at Stanford University. It serves as a portal for the reader to explore a slideshow of 41 landscape photographs of the Grand Canyon taken by Henry Peabody circa 1905, and seamlessly links with essays written for the parent project to allow the reader to spatially orient themselves in the Grand Canyon as they peruse through the photographs and the essays. The interactive map features two exploration modes: station point mode and location mode. Descriptions of the functionality of each mode are provided below.

### Station Point Mode
